In absence of food the cell operates in survival mode. In survival mode the main objective is to save energy and use all the biomass available to cell efficiently.
Oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation are activated and glycolysis is repressed.
Autophagy is activated and fatty acid synthesis is repressed. most of the cells in normal tissues are in quiescent/survival mode.
some examples(out of many) are Treg cells, resting T cells, memory T cells and stem cells.
