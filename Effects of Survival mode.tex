\textbf Survival mode results in cell having longer health and lifespan. Main reasons are :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Enhanced autophagy leading to cleanup of cell debris
\item Increased number of peroxisomes leading to digestion of long chain fatty acids and reduced lipid peroxidation
\item Enhanced Cholesterol Export resulting in reduced lipid peroxidation
\item Reduced chance of apoptosis
\end{enumerate}
