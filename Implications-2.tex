What are the implications?
there are many areas where we can use this idea. for example: cancer cells other than cancer stem cells have to be in growth mode to proliferate. we can force them to shift to survival mode by activating AMPK and Sirtuins. Or we can add fuels like ketone bodies that inhibit glycolysis thereby stopping a cell in growth mode. Similarly in auto immune diseases the T effector cells are activated and are in growth mode and can be handled as above. Aging is another process that may be understood in terms of percentage of cells in growth mode and full of debris. We can activate autophagy and thereby clean the cells by shifting cells to survival mode
