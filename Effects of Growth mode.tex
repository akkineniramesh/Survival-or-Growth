\textbf Growth mode results in cell having shorter lifespan. Main reasons are :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reduced autophagy leading to pile up of debris
\item Reduced number of peroxisomes leading to more substrates for lipid peroxidation
\item Reduced cholesterol export leading to increased lipid peroxidation
\item Increased chance of apoptosis
\end{enumerate}
