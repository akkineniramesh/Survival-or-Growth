\textit{For primitive beings like us, life seems to only have one single purpose. Gaining time.}
\textit{And its going thru’ time, seems to be also the only real purpose of each of the cell in our bodies.}
\textit{To achieve that aim, the mass of the cells that make up earth worm and human beings has only 2 solutions.}
\textit{Be Immortal…or to reproduce.}
\\
\textit{If its habitat is not sufficiently favorable, or nurturing, the cell will choose immortality, in other words, self-sufficiency and self management. On the other hand, if the habitat is favorable, they will choose to reproduce — that way, when they die, they hand essential information and knowledge to the next cell, which hands it down to the next cell, and so on. Thus knowledge and learning are handed down, through time.}
\textit{---Professor Norman in the film 'Lucy'}
