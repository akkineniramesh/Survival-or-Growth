Absence of Food is an important information that cell needs to store so that it can operate in survival mode. 'Food scarcity' message is critical and cell has different pathways and checkpoints to detect 'Food scarcity'. AMPK, Sirtuins and other proteins maintain the 'Food scarcity' message. They activate pathways related to Survival mode and inhibit pathways related to Growth mode.
